The main objective of this project is to being able to distinguish between the defective and non - defective potato chip pieces. For doing this we got the Data set from Kaggle which is the official pepsico dataset for potato chips.
Where as in this mahcine learning model the main mathematics involved in it are Support Vector Regression, Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Mean squared error value.

For the working of the program it works in the way as follows. This Python script utilizes the OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image libraries to implement a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) model for defect detection in potato images. The training dataset consists of defective and non-defective potato images, which are resized and represented as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The SVR is trained on these features, and the model is evaluated using mean squared error. The testing dataset, containing unseen potato images, undergoes the same preprocessing steps, and predictions are made using the trained SVR model. The code concludes by displaying the number of defective and non-defective pieces in the test set and reporting the mean squared error which is an evaluation metric. Key concepts used here are image loading, resizing, HOG feature extraction, SVR training, and model evaluation.


For the better understanding of the concepts and the math involved in the machine learning project I've included a couple of reference papers supporting the concepts behind the machine learning model.
